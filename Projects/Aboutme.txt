A little about me - Section 1

Hey, I'm Zeeshan

I'm a Full-Stack Geospatial Developer and Spatial Data Analyst with a strong foundation in GIS, remote sensing, and data engineering. I specialize in building smart geospatial solutions, whether it's automating workflows, creating interactive web maps, or designing spatial databases—to turn complex spatial data into actionable insights.


What Drives Me - Section 2

Curiosity: I love solving problems that sit at the crossroads of data, technology, and geography.

Impact: For me, it’s not just about writing code, it’s about creating solutions that help people make better decisions.

Innovation: From cloud-based processing to web-mapping applications, I enjoy pushing the boundaries of what geospatial tech can do.


My Journey - Section 3

My story started with a fascination for maps that turned into a passion for geospatial technology:

Education:

MSc in Spatial Engineering at University of Twente, Netherlands

Bachelor’s in Geoinformatics Engineering from NUST, Pakistan

Professional Experience:

Built custom geospatial features at CGI Netherlands during my internship.

Designed PostGIS databases and automated pipelines at IQLand.ai for real estate data processing.

Automated remote sensing workflows using Python and Google Earth Engine at GeoTech.

Developed front-end mapping modules for REMAP.ai using Node.js and Vue.js.

Freelance: Delivered 80+ projects worldwide on Fiverr and Upwork, including API development, data processing, and web GIS platforms.


How I Approach Projects - Section 4

Every project is different, but my process stays consistent:

Understand the problem: What’s the challenge and who’s impacted?

Plan the solution: Select the right tools—whether Python, PostGIS, or web frameworks.

Build & Automate: Develop efficient, scalable solutions using best practices (Docker, Git, CI/CD).

Validate: Test performance, usability, and accuracy.

Deliver & Communicate: Make it accessible—through dashboards, APIs, or interactive maps.


Projects I’m Proud Of - Section 5

Agromap
Built a complete web GIS solution for agricultural monitoring with Leaflet, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, and responsive graphs.

Weather Station Data API
Developed a REST API using FastAPI to serve real-time weather data from PostGIS databases for integration into dashboards.

Forest Cover Change Detection
Automated satellite image processing in Google Earth Engine to detect forest cover changes using machine learning models.

Solar Panel Detection Using U-Net
Trained a deep learning model for rooftop solar panel detection from high-resolution imagery.

Beyond Work - Section 6

Passionate about data engineering/science and making complex data easy to understand.

When I’m not working, you’ll find me playing sports, travelling, or just playing a game of FIFA.
